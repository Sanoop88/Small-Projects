# Small-Projects
A collection of small projects I've been tinkering with

Top10songs.py :  Fetches the top 10 songs and top 10 artists of the week and moves them into an ordered text file to path of your choosing.

Reddit_showerthoughts.py: If you like Showerthoughts in reddit, you might like this. It gets you the Top 10 showerthoughts for the day. You need to register your reddit API first.
